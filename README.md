<p text-align="center">
What's up, it's D111GENT (Diligent)! I'm a code-slinging, caffeine-addicted, tech ninja who's always on the lookout for new challenges. I thrive on progress and love to learn new things, especially when it comes to solving problems and understanding how things work. Currently, I'm taking on a new challenge, and I'd love for you to take a peek! But please, don't take away my Wi-Fi - I need it to keep pushing forward!
