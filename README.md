<h1 align="center"> Meet D111GENT</h1>
<div align="center">
<p text-align="center"> I am a beginner in the field of blockchain bug bounties, but I am eager to learn and improve my skills. I believe that "everybody's got to start somewhere," and I am excited to take my first steps in this exciting and rapidly-evolving field.

As I continue to explore the world of blockchain technology and bug bounties, I will be sharing [my progress](https://github.com/D111GENT/my-progress/blob/main/README.md) and discoveries here on my GitHub profile. This will include any relevant projects I am working on, as well as any tips and tricks I have learned along the way.

I am always open to feedback and suggestions, so please feel free to [reach out to me](https://twitter.com/D111Gent) if you have any thoughts or ideas on how I can improve my skills or approach to blockchain bug bounties.

Thanks for stopping by, and I hope you find my journey in this field as interesting as I do!</p>
