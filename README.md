<h1 align="center">About Me</h1>
<div align="center">
<p text-align="center">
I am a cybersecurity enthusiast with a passion for exploring and being curious about computers since I was 10. I specialize in using MITRE D3FEND strategies, ontology using Protege, and network analysis using Wireshark. My present focus is on blue teaming, but I hope to become a pentester one day. I love participating in TryHackMe, CTFs, taking courses on Udemy, and watching YouTube videos to learn. As I learn, I also create YouTube videos for fun.

# My Goal
My hope is to one day create my own security operations center (SOC) and help the general public understand threats, what they are capable of, and how they can be prevented. I am actively looking for ways to contribute to the cybersecurity community.
